  <h1>What Is Custom Police Patches</h1>

  <p>
    <a href="https://www.fineystpatches.com/patches/custom-police-patches" title="Custom Police Patches">Custom police patches</a>
    are identification patches used by law enforcement departments, security agencies, and tactical response teams to display rank, unit name, division, and authority. These patches follow strict production standards because they must remain visible, durable, and readable in different duty conditions. Organizations searching for custom patches online use this category for uniforms, vests, jackets, and duty bags.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Law Enforcement Uses Police Patches</h2>
  <p>
    Police officers rely on custom embroidered patches for clothing and high visibility uniform applications. For tactical operations, many departments prefer custom PVC patches because they resist water, impact, and outdoor wear. Agencies also use custom velcro patches for uniforms since they allow fast removal and transfer between vests, jackets, and field gear. Custom woven patches and custom leather patches for jackets are often used for ceremonial uniforms, training academies, and specialty units.
  </p>

  <h2>How Custom Police Patches Are Manufactured</h2>
  <p>
    Production begins with your badge, insignia, or department lettering. The design is converted into a machine-ready format and matched with the correct material whether embroidered, woven, PVC, leather, or iron-on. For daily duty use, velcro backing is recommended because it allows officers to switch patches between gear without sewing.
